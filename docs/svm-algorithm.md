## Introduction

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. Developed by Vladimir Vapnik and his colleagues in the 1990s, SVM is based on the concept of finding an optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space.

### Why SVM for Diabetes Prediction?

SVM is particularly well-suited for diabetes prediction because:

- **High-dimensional data handling**: Medical datasets often have multiple features
- **Non-linear relationships**: Can capture complex patterns between medical indicators
- **Robust to overfitting**: Especially effective with smaller datasets
- **Interpretability**: Decision boundaries provide insights into feature importance
- **Proven medical applications**: Widely used in medical diagnosis and prediction

## Mathematical Foundation

### Linear SVM

The fundamental goal of SVM is to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes.

#### Hyperplane Equation

For a linear SVM, the decision boundary is defined by:

```
f(x) = w^T x + b = 0
```

Where:

- `w` = weight vector (normal to the hyperplane)
- `x` = input feature vector
- `b` = bias term

#### Classification Rule

The classification decision is made based on:

```
y = sign(w^T x + b)
```

Where:

- `y = +1` for positive class (diabetes)
- `y = -1` for negative class (no diabetes)

#### Optimization Problem

SVM solves the following optimization problem:

**Minimize:**

```
(1/2)||w||² + C Σ ξᵢ
```

**Subject to:**

```
yᵢ(w^T xᵢ + b) ≥ 1 - ξᵢ
ξᵢ ≥ 0
```

Where:

- `||w||²` = regularization term
- `C` = regularization parameter
- `ξᵢ` = slack variables for soft margin
- `yᵢ` = true label for sample i
- `xᵢ` = feature vector for sample i

### Dual Formulation

The dual problem is solved using Lagrange multipliers:

**Maximize:**

```
L(α) = Σ αᵢ - (1/2) Σ Σ αᵢ αⱼ yᵢ yⱼ K(xᵢ, xⱼ)
```

**Subject to:**

```
Σ αᵢ yᵢ = 0
0 ≤ αᵢ ≤ C
```

Where:

- `αᵢ` = Lagrange multipliers
- `K(xᵢ, xⱼ)` = kernel function

## Key Concepts

### 1. Support Vectors

- **Definition**: Data points that lie closest to the decision boundary
- **Importance**: Only support vectors determine the hyperplane
- **Properties**:
  - Have non-zero Lagrange multipliers (αᵢ > 0)
  - Critical for model prediction
  - Removal affects the decision boundary

### 2. Margin

- **Hard Margin**: Strict separation with no misclassified points
- **Soft Margin**: Allows some misclassification for better generalization
- **Maximum Margin**: Distance between hyperplane and nearest support vectors

### 3. Hyperplane

- **Linear Hyperplane**: Straight line (2D), plane (3D), or hyperplane (>3D)
- **Non-linear Decision Boundary**: Achieved through kernel trick
- **Optimal Hyperplane**: Maximizes margin while minimizing classification error

## Types of SVM

### 1. Linear SVM

**Use Case:** When data is linearly separable or nearly linearly separable

**Characteristics:**

- Fast training and prediction
- Good interpretability
- Works well with high-dimensional data
- Less prone to overfitting

**Mathematical Form:**

```python
f(x) = w₀ + w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ
```

### 2. Non-linear SVM (Kernel SVM)

**Use Case:** When data is not linearly separable

**Characteristics:**

- Uses kernel trick to map data to higher dimensions
- Can capture complex patterns
- More flexible but computationally intensive
- Risk of overfitting with complex kernels

## Kernel Functions

Kernels allow SVM to create non-linear decision boundaries by implicitly mapping data to higher-dimensional spaces.

### 1. Linear Kernel

**Formula:**

```
K(xᵢ, xⱼ) = xᵢ^T xⱼ
```

**Properties:**

- Simplest kernel
- Fast computation
- Good for linearly separable data
- High-dimensional sparse data

**Use Case for Diabetes:**

- When medical indicators show linear relationships
- Large number of features relative to samples

### 2. Polynomial Kernel

**Formula:**

```
K(xᵢ, xⱼ) = (γ xᵢ^T xⱼ + r)^d
```

**Parameters:**

- `γ` (gamma): kernel coefficient
- `r`: independent term
- `d`: degree of polynomial

**Properties:**

- Captures feature interactions
- Degree controls complexity
- Can model curved decision boundaries

**Use Case for Diabetes:**

- When interactions between medical factors matter
- BMI × Age interactions
- Glucose × Insulin relationships

### 3. Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel

**Formula:**

```
K(xᵢ, xⱼ) = exp(-γ ||xᵢ - xⱼ||²)
```

**Parameters:**

- `γ` (gamma): controls kernel width
- Higher γ: more complex, localized decisions
- Lower γ: smoother, more generalized decisions

**Properties:**

- Most popular kernel
- Can handle non-linear relationships
- Good general-purpose choice
- Sensitive to feature scaling

**Use Case for Diabetes:**

- Complex non-linear relationships between features
- When you don't know the underlying pattern
- Default choice for medical prediction

### 4. Sigmoid Kernel

**Formula:**

```
K(xᵢ, xⱼ) = tanh(γ xᵢ^T xⱼ + r)
```

**Properties:**

- Similar to neural networks
- Can behave like logistic regression
- Less commonly used
- May not satisfy Mercer's conditions

**Use Case for Diabetes:**

- When you want neural network-like behavior
- Probabilistic interpretations

## Hyperparameter Tuning

### 1. Regularization Parameter (C)

**Purpose:** Controls trade-off between margin maximization and misclassification

**Effects:**

- **High C (C → ∞)**: Hard margin, low bias, high variance

  - Tries to classify all training examples correctly
  - May overfit to training data
  - Complex decision boundary

- **Low C (C → 0)**: Soft margin, high bias, low variance
  - Allows more misclassifications
  - Simpler decision boundary
  - Better generalization

**Typical Values:** 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000

**For Diabetes Prediction:**

- Start with C=1
- Increase if underfitting (high bias)
- Decrease if overfitting (high variance)

### 2. Gamma (γ) Parameter

**Purpose:** Controls kernel coefficient for RBF, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels

**Effects:**

- **High γ**:

  - Tight fit around training samples
  - Complex decision boundary
  - Risk of overfitting
  - Low bias, high variance

- **Low γ**:
  - Smooth decision boundary
  - Better generalization
  - Risk of underfitting
  - High bias, low variance

**Typical Values:** 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10

**For Diabetes Prediction:**

- Start with γ='scale' (1/(n_features × X.var()))
- Adjust based on validation performance

### 3. Kernel Selection

**Guidelines:**

1. **Start with RBF kernel** (most versatile)
2. **Try linear kernel** if RBF is slow or you have many features
3. **Consider polynomial** if you suspect feature interactions
4. **Use cross-validation** to compare kernels

### 4. Hyperparameter Optimization Strategies

#### Grid Search

```python
param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100],
    'gamma': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1],
    'kernel': ['rbf', 'linear', 'poly']
}
```

#### Random Search

- More efficient for large parameter spaces
- Good for initial exploration

#### Bayesian Optimization

- More sophisticated approach
- Learns from previous evaluations
- Better for expensive evaluations

## SVM for Diabetes Prediction

### Feature Preprocessing

#### 1. Feature Scaling

**Why Important:**

- SVM is sensitive to feature scales
- Features with larger scales dominate
- Affects distance calculations in kernel functions

**Methods:**

```python
# Standardization (recommended)
StandardScaler(): mean=0, std=1

# Min-Max Scaling
MinMaxScaler(): range [0,1]

# Robust Scaling (for outliers)
RobustScaler(): uses median and IQR
```

#### 2. Handling Missing Values

For the diabetes dataset, zero values in certain features represent missing data:

**Strategy 1: Median Imputation**

```python
# Replace zeros with median for affected features
features_with_zeros = ['Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI']
```

**Strategy 2: KNN Imputation**

```python
# Use K-nearest neighbors for imputation
KNNImputer(n_neighbors=5)
```

### Model Architecture

#### 1. Feature Selection

**Relevant Features for Diabetes:**

- **Primary**: Glucose, BMI, Age
- **Secondary**: Insulin, BloodPressure, Pregnancies
- **Tertiary**: SkinThickness, DiabetesPedigreeFunction

#### 2. Class Imbalance Handling

**Dataset Distribution:**

- No Diabetes: 500 samples (65.1%)
- Diabetes: 268 samples (34.9%)

**Strategies:**

1. **Class Weight Balancing**

   ```python
   class_weight='balanced'  # Automatically adjust weights
   ```

2. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)**

   ```python
   from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
   smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
   X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
   ```

3. **Cost-Sensitive Learning**
   ```python
   # Adjust C parameter for different classes
   class_weight = {0: 1, 1: 1.87}  # Inverse of class frequencies
   ```

### Model Training Pipeline

#### 1. Data Splitting

```python
# Stratified split to maintain class distribution
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state=42
)
```

#### 2. Cross-Validation

```python
# Stratified K-fold for robust evaluation
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
```

#### 3. Model Selection Process

```python
# Step 1: Kernel selection with default parameters
kernels = ['linear', 'rbf', 'poly']

# Step 2: Hyperparameter tuning for best kernel
param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100],
    'gamma': ['scale', 'auto', 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1]
}

# Step 3: Final model training and evaluation
```

- Critical for medical diagnosis (avoid missing cases)

**Specificity**

```
Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)
```

- How many non-diabetes cases were correctly identified
- Important for avoiding unnecessary treatments

**False Negative Cost**: Missing a diabetes case

- **Consequence**: Delayed treatment, disease progression
- **Cost**: High (potential serious health complications)

**False Positive Cost**: Incorrectly diagnosing diabetes

- **Consequence**: Unnecessary treatment, anxiety
- **Cost**: Moderate (unnecessary medical intervention)

**Optimal Threshold Selection**

```python
# Custom scoring function
def medical_score(y_true, y_pred):
    tn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred).ravel()
    # Assign higher cost to false negatives
    cost = fp * 1 + fn * 5  # FN is 5x more costly than FP
    return -cost  # Negative because we want to minimize cost
```

### Cross-Validation Strategies

from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier

# SGD with SVM loss
online_svm = SGDClassifier(loss='hinge', learning_rate='adaptive')
```

### 4. Multi-class Extension

Although diabetes prediction is binary, SVM can handle multi-class:
