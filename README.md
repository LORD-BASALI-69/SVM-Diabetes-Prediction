## Project Overview
The SVM Diabetes Prediction project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict diabetes risk based on medical data. This model analyzes eight features from the Pima Indian dataset, including glucose levels, BMI, and age. The model achieves an accuracy of 75-80%.

## Usage
To use the SVM Diabetes Prediction model, follow these steps:

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:
   Start Jupyter Notebook in the project directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Load the Model**:
   Open the provided notebook file and load the trained SVM model.

3. **Input Data**:
   Enter the required medical features in the designated fields.

4. **Get Predictions**:
   Run the prediction cell to see the diabetes risk result.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is crucial for effective model training. The following steps are taken:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values by replacing them with the mean or median.
   - Remove duplicates to ensure data integrity.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Select relevant features such as glucose, BMI, age, etc.
   - Drop irrelevant columns to reduce noise.

3. **Data Normalization**:
   - Scale features to a standard range using Min-Max scaling or Standardization.
   - This helps the SVM model perform better.

## Model Training
The model training process includes the following steps:

1. **Split the Data**:
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.

2. **Initialize the SVM Classifier**:
   - Choose the appropriate kernel (linear, polynomial, etc.) based on data distribution.

3. **Train the Model**:
   - Fit the SVM model on the training data.
   - Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well.

4. **Save the Model**:
   - Use joblib or pickle to save the trained model for future use.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluating the model's performance is essential. The following metrics are used:

1. **Accuracy Score**:
   - Calculate the accuracy of the model on the test set.
   - Aim for an accuracy between 75-80%.

2. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - Visualize the performance of the model.
   - Helps identify false positives and negatives.

3. **Classification Report**:
   - Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for better understanding.

## Prediction System
The prediction system allows users to input medical data and receive predictions. 

1. **Input Features**:
   - Users enter values for glucose, BMI, age, etc.

2. **Run Prediction**:
   - The model processes the input and returns the diabetes risk.

3. **Output**:
   - The system displays whether the user is at risk for diabetes.
